# PandeAkshat DAO

> A decentralized governance and collaboration layer for the PandeAkshat ecosystem.

---

## 📘 Overview

PandeAkshat DAO aims to establish a decentralized governance model for AI and data-driven collaboration within the PandeAkshat ecosystem. It enables contributors, developers, and AI systems to participate in decision-making, project funding, and ecosystem evolution transparently. By combining blockchain-based voting with real-world AI project management, the DAO envisions sustainable, community-driven growth.

- Type: Decentralized Platform / Research DAO  
- Tech Stack: Solidity, Ethereum / Polygon, IPFS, Next.js, Supabase  
- Status: In Concept / Planning  

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Token-based governance and voting mechanism.  
- Transparent proposal creation, discussion, and execution.  
- On-chain integration for tracking project milestones and funding.

Explain briefly how your components fit together:
- Smart contracts manage governance, voting, and treasury functions.  
- The frontend interacts with blockchain via Web3 and Supabase APIs.  
- Proposal data and contributor records are stored transparently on-chain.
